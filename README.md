# Product Leadership & Product Management Prompts

A curated collection of AI prompts designed to accelerate product management workflows, strategic planning, and leadership decisions. These prompts leverage AI capabilities to enhance product discovery, strategy development, stakeholder communication, and decision-making processes.

## Overview

This repository contains battle-tested prompts for product managers and product leaders working with AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to streamline common PM activities, from market research to roadmap development to customer communication.

## How to Use These Prompts

### Basic Usage

1. **Select the appropriate prompt** for your current task or challenge
2. **Customize the variables** (marked in `[brackets]` or `{curly braces}`)
3. **Paste into your AI assistant** of choice
4. **Iterate and refine** based on initial outputs
5. **Validate results** with your domain expertise and context

### Best Practices

- **Provide Context**: Always add relevant background information about your product, market, and constraints
- **Be Specific**: Replace placeholders with actual details from your situation
- **Iterate**: Start broad, then narrow down with follow-up questions
