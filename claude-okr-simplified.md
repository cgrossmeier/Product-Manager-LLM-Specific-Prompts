## Multi-Step Prompt

Help me develop quarterly OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) for my product. Let's work through this step-by-step.

**What are OKRs?**
- **Objective**: Qualitative, ambitious goal (e.g., "Become the preferred solution for small teams")
- **Key Results**: 3-5 quantitative outcomes showing progress (e.g., "Increase NPS from 45 to 60")
- **Timeframe**: Quarterly (90 days)
- **Purpose**: Drive strategic change and new direction

## Step 1: Tell Me About Your Product

Please share the following information:

### Product Basics
- **Product name**: [Your product]
- **What it does**: [1-2 sentence description]
- **Product stage**: Early-stage / Growth / Mature
- **Business model**: SaaS / Marketplace / E-commerce / Other

### Current Scale
- **Users or customers**: [Approximate count]
- **Monthly revenue (if applicable)**: [Amount or "Pre-revenue"]
- **Team size**: [Product team headcount]

### Customers
- **Primary customer**: [Who they are - title/role/company type]
- **Main problem solved**: [What pain point you address]
- **Top customer need**: [What they most want from you]

### Use Cases
- **Primary use case**: [Most common way customers use your product]
- **Secondary use case**: [Second most common usage]
- **Usage frequency**: How often do users engage? (Daily / Weekly / Monthly)

### Current State
- **What's working well**: [One thing that's performing great]
- **Biggest challenge**: [One major problem or obstacle]
- **Strategic priority**: [What matters most this quarter]

---

## Step 2: I'll Ask Clarifying Questions

Based on what you share, I'll ask 3-5 focused questions about:
- Your strategic goals for the quarter
- Current metrics and baseline data
- Resource constraints or dependencies
- Desired ambition level

---

## Step 3: I'll Generate Draft OKRs

I'll provide 3-5 Objectives, each with 3-5 Key Results:

**Format for each OKR:**

**Objective**: [Ambitious, qualitative goal]

**Why this matters**: [Strategic rationale]

**Key Results:**
1. [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]
2. [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]
3. [Metric] from [baseline] to [target]

**Categories covered:**
- Growth (acquisition, expansion)
- Engagement (activation, retention)
- Product (features, experience)
- Revenue (monetization, expansion)
- Customer Success (satisfaction, value)

---

## Step 4: We'll Refine Together

I'll ask:
- Which objectives align best with your strategy?
- Are key result targets realistic given your baseline?
- What's missing or misaligned?
- Which OKR feels most critical?

We'll adjust until you have 3-5 strong OKRs.

## Step 5: I'll Create Your OKR Reference Document

**Final deliverable includes:**

### 1. Executive Summary
- Quarter and timeframe
- Strategic context
- High-level priorities

### 2. Complete OKR Set

For each Objective:
- **Objective statement**
- **Strategic rationale** (why this matters)
- **Key Results** (3-5 measurable outcomes)
- **Baseline metrics** (where you are today)
- **Target metrics** (where you aim to be)
- **Measurement method** (how to track)
- **Owner** (who's responsible)
- **Confidence level** (% likelihood of achieving)

### 3. Tracking Framework
- **Data sources**: Where metrics come from
- **Update frequency**: How often to check progress
- **Dashboard structure**: What to monitor weekly
- **Review schedule**: When to assess formally

### 4. Implementation Guide
- **Key initiatives**: Major projects supporting each OKR
- **Dependencies**: What you need from others
- **Milestones**: Quarterly checkpoints
- **Risk factors**: What could derail success

### 5. Best Practices for Your Product
- **Industry benchmarks**: How you compare
- **Success patterns**: What worked for similar products
- **Common pitfalls**: What to avoid
- **Leading indicators**: Early signals of success/trouble

### 6. Measurement Details

For each Key Result:
- **Calculation formula**: Exactly how to compute
- **Data source**: Where to get the data
- **Update cadence**: Daily / Weekly / Monthly
- **Target rationale**: Why this target makes sense
- **Success threshold**: What counts as achieved (typically 70%+)

### 7. Progress Tracking Template
- **Weekly update format**: How to report progress
- **Monthly review agenda**: What to discuss
- **Adjustment criteria**: When to revise OKRs
- **End-of-quarter retrospective**: How to evaluate

## Let's Begin!

**Please provide the information from Step 1 above.**

You can be brief - I'll ask follow-up questions to get the details needed for great OKRs.

## Quick Start Option

**If you want to move fast, provide just this:**

```
Product: [Name - what it does]
Customer: [Who uses it and why]
Current state: [Key metric and value]
Goal: [What you want to achieve this quarter]
Challenge: [Biggest obstacle]
```

**Example:**
```
Product: TaskFlow - team project management for agencies
Customer: Creative agency project managers, need better client visibility
Current state: 500 users, 40% monthly retention
Goal: Improve retention and drive word-of-mouth growth
Challenge: Users don't adopt key collaboration features
```

I'll generate draft OKRs from this and we'll refine from there!
