So that I can quickly identify coaching opportunities and top performers

Given I'm viewing the team dashboard
When I select "Compare Reps"
Then I see a sortable table with key metrics for each rep
```

**Poor User Story:**
```
As a user
I want better reports
So that I can see data
```
[Too vague, no specificity, unclear value]
