**Platform:** Claude (Sonnet 4.5 / Opus 4)

## Prompt

I need your help conducting a comprehensive customer pain point analysis for my product. Act as an expert product strategist and market researcher who specializes in uncovering deep customer needs and prioritizing problems worth solving.

**Product Context:**
- Product name: [Your product]
- Target market: [Industry/segment]
- Current stage: [Early stage / Growth / Mature]
- Known alternatives: [Competitor solutions]

**Research Data Available:**
- Customer interviews: [Number of interviews, key segments]
- Support tickets: [Volume, timeframe]
- Sales conversations: [Common objections]
- User analytics: [Friction points, drop-off areas]
- Survey data: [If available]

## Analysis Framework

Please analyze and structure pain points using this framework:

### For Each Pain Point Identified:

**Pain Point Name:** [Clear, descriptive label]

**Description:** What is the problem in customer's own words?

**Severity Score (1-10):**
- 10 = Critical blocker, prevents success entirely
- 7-9 = Major pain, significant impact on workflows
- 4-6 = Moderate pain, workarounds exist but painful
- 1-3 = Minor inconvenience

**Frequency Score (1-10):**
- 10 = Daily/constant occurrence
- 7-9 = Multiple times per week
- 4-6 = Weekly or monthly
- 1-3 = Rarely encountered

**Customer Impact:**
- Quantified business impact (time, money, opportunity cost)
- Emotional impact (frustration, stress, risk)
- Strategic impact (competitive disadvantage, growth limitation)

**Current Workarounds:**
How customers currently handle this (manual processes, competitor tools, simply live with it)

**Customer Evidence:**
- Direct quotes from interviews/tickets
- Data points supporting severity
- Observable behaviors

**Affected User Segments:**
Which customer types feel this most acutely?

**Root Cause Analysis:**
What's the underlying problem driving this pain?

## Prioritization Matrix

After analyzing all pain points, create a 2x2 matrix:

**Axes:**
- X-axis: Frequency (how often encountered)
- Y-axis: Severity (impact when encountered)

**Quadrants:**
- **Critical & Common** (High severity, high frequency): Top priority
- **Painful but Rare** (High severity, low frequency): Important edge cases
- **Frequent Annoyances** (Low severity, high frequency): Death by 1000 cuts
- **Low Priority** (Low severity, low frequency): Deprioritize

## Strategic Insights

Provide:

1. **Top 5 Pain Points** ranked by (Severity × Frequency × Market Size)
2. **Unmet Needs** - problems customers have given up trying to solve
3. **Emerging Patterns** - trends across multiple pain points
4. **Segment-Specific Pains** - unique problems for specific customer types
5. **Competitive Gaps** - pain points competitors also haven't solved
6. **Solution Opportunities** - which pains could we uniquely solve?

## Output Format

Please structure your analysis as:
1. Executive Summary (3-4 paragraphs)
2. Detailed Pain Point Catalog (table format)
3. Prioritization Matrix (visual quadrant description)
4. Strategic Recommendations
5. Suggested Next Steps for validation

## Tips for Best Results

- Include both explicit pains (what customers say) and implicit pains (what data shows)
- Distinguish between symptoms and root causes
- Consider both rational (business) and emotional (human) impacts
- Note if pain points vary by customer segment, company size, or maturity
- Identify pain points that are getting worse over time vs. stable
