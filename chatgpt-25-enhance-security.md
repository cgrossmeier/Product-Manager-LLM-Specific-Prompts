### Additional Guidance

**Security Principles to Apply:**
- **Defense-in-Depth:** Multiple layers of security
- **Least Privilege:** Minimal access by default
- **Zero Trust:** Never trust, always verify
- **Secure by Default:** Security is opt-out, not opt-in
- **Fail Securely:** Failures don't compromise security
- **Privacy by Design:** Privacy built-in from start
- **Separation of Duties:** No single point of compromise
- **Complete Mediation:** Check every access

**Frameworks to Reference:**
- OWASP Top 10 / ASVS
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Critical Security Controls
- MITRE ATT&CK
- Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)
- ISO 27001/27002
- SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

**Avoid:**
- Security theater (looks secure but isn't)
- One-time fixes without ongoing monitoring
- Obscurity as security
- Over-reliance on single security layer
- Solutions that significantly degrade usability

### Desired Output Quality

Each enhancement should be:
- **Threat-Specific:** Addresses concrete attack vectors
- **Measurable:** Can track security improvement
- **Implementable:** Clear enough for security team
- **Standards-Aligned:** Maps to recognized frameworks
- **Risk-Reducing:** Demonstrable security benefit
