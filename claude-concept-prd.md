## Prompt

I need your help creating a Concept PRD (Product Requirements Document) designed to secure executive support and buy-in for a new product initiative. This document should be persuasive, strategic, and comprehensive while remaining concise enough for busy executives.

**Initiative Context:**

**Audience:**
- Primary: [CEO, CPO, CTO, Board, etc.]
- Decision needed: [Funding approval, resource allocation, strategic direction]
- Key concerns they'll have: [Risk, ROI, timing, competition]

## Concept PRD Structure

Write a compelling 1-paragraph (5-7 sentences) summary that includes:
- The opportunity in one sentence
- The customer problem and its severity
- Our proposed solution
- Expected business impact

Make this paragraph self-contained - if executives read nothing else, they should understand the key points.

- Our differentiation or unique advantage
- Barriers to entry we can create

### 3. Product Vision & Solution

## Tips for Best Results

- Lead with customer pain and business opportunity, not features
- Use data and evidence over assertions
- Show you've considered alternatives and risks
- Make the investment ask clear and justified
- Include executive-friendly visuals (describe what charts/diagrams to include)
- Anticipate objections and address them proactively
- End with a clear call to action
