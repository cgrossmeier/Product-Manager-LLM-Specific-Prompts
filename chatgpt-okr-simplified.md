## Step 2: Clarifying Questions

After you provide Step 1 info, I'll ask 3-5 targeted questions about:
- Specific goals for this quarter
- Baseline metrics and targets
- Resource constraints
- Ambition level preference

---

## Step 3: Draft OKR Generation

I'll generate 3-5 Objectives covering different focus areas:

### OKR Format

**Objective [#]: [Ambitious Goal Statement]**

**Strategic Context:** [Why this matters]

**Key Results:**
1. [Metric Name]: Increase from [baseline] to [target]
2. [Metric Name]: Achieve [target] (from [baseline])
3. [Metric Name]: Improve from [baseline] to [target]

**Owner:** [Responsible person/team]
**Confidence:** [%] likelihood of achieving at 70%+ level

### Categories Covered

| Category | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| **Growth** | User acquisition, market expansion |
| **Engagement** | Activation, usage, retention |
| **Product** | Features, experience, quality |
| **Revenue** | Monetization, ARPU, conversion |
| **Customer Success** | Satisfaction, value delivery |

---

## Step 4: Refinement

I'll ask:
- Which objectives resonate most?
- Are targets realistic based on your baseline?
- What's missing or misaligned?
- Which OKR is most critical?

We'll iterate until you have 3-5 strong, actionable OKRs.

---

## Step 5: OKR Reference Document

I'll create a comprehensive reference document with these sections:

### Document Structure

**1. Executive Summary**
- Timeframe (Q[X] YYYY)
- Strategic priorities
- How OKRs connect to company goals

**2. Complete OKR Set**

For each Objective:

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Objective** | [Qualitative goal statement] |
| **Rationale** | Why this matters strategically |
| **Key Result 1** | [Metric] from [X] to [Y] |
| **Key Result 2** | [Metric] from [X] to [Y] |
| **Key Result 3** | [Metric] from [X] to [Y] |
| **Baseline Date** | [When baseline measured] |
| **Measurement Method** | [How to calculate] |
| **Owner/DRI** | [Person responsible] |
| **Confidence Level** | [%] |

**3. Measurement Framework**

| Key Result | Data Source | Calculation | Update Frequency | Dashboard Location |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [KR 1] | [Tool/system] | [Formula] | Daily/Weekly/Monthly | [Link/location] |

**4. Implementation Plan**

| OKR | Key Initiatives | Milestones | Dependencies | Resources Needed |
|-----|----------------|------------|--------------|------------------|
| [Objective 1] | [Projects] | [Q checkpoints] | [What's needed] | [Team/budget] |

**5. Best Practices for Your Product**

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Relevant metrics comparison
- Typical growth rates for your stage
- Success patterns from similar products

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Risks to watch for
- Known failure modes
- How to avoid common mistakes

**Leading Indicators:**
- Early signals of success
- Red flags to monitor
- Diagnostic metrics to track

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- Timing factors affecting results
- Cyclical patterns to expect

**6. Tracking & Reviews**

**Weekly Progress Tracking:**
```
OKR: [Name]
Current Progress: [% complete]
Trend: ↑ On track / → At risk / ↓ Needs attention
Blockers: [List]
Actions: [Next steps]
```

**Monthly Review Agenda:**
1. Progress update on each Key Result
2. Trend analysis (improving/stable/declining)
3. Blockers and mitigation plans
4. Resource reallocation if needed
5. Adjustment recommendations

**Quarterly Retrospective:**
- Final achievement scores (0-100% per KR)
- What worked well
- What didn't work and why
- Lessons for next quarter

**7. Scoring Guide**

| Achievement Level | Score | Interpretation |
|------------------|-------|----------------|
| 0-30% | Red | Significant miss, investigate |
| 40-60% | Yellow | Partial success, learn why |
| 70-100% | Green | Success! (70% is target) |
| 100%+ | Purple | Exceeded! May have aimed low |

**Ideal:** Most OKRs score 60-80% (ambitious but achievable)

**8. Adjustment Criteria**

**When to Revise OKRs:**
- Major market changes or competitive shifts
- Strategic priority changes from leadership
- Discovered baseline was incorrect (>30% off)
- Dependency failure makes OKR unachievable
- New opportunity makes OKR less relevant

**How to Adjust:**
- Document reason for change
- Get stakeholder alignment
- Update baseline and targets
- Communicate broadly
- Don't change just because it's hard
