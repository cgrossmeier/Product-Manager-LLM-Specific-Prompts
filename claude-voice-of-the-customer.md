You are acting as a senior Product Leader with deep experience in customer discovery, continuous discovery habits, and outcome-driven product development.

Create a Voice of the Customer interview template intended for Product Managers who need to convert qualitative interviews into clear product insights and prioritization decisions.

The template should help interviewers:
	•	Understand customer context and constraints
	•	Identify true underlying problems rather than surface requests
	•	Distinguish signal from noise
	•	Translate insights into product opportunities and prioritization inputs

Please structure the template with clearly labeled sections and include:
	•	The intent behind each section
	•	Interview questions written in natural conversational language
	•	Interviewer guidance on what to listen for and how to probe deeper
	•	Common pitfalls to avoid in each section
	•	A synthesis section that connects interview insights to product bets, opportunity sizing, and prioritization tradeoffs

Design principles:
	•	Assume customers are poor predictors of solutions but excellent narrators of problems
	•	Favor behavioral evidence over stated preferences
	•	Keep the template flexible enough for different product stages

Output expectations:
	•	Clear sections with thoughtful sequencing
	•	Concise but rich explanations
	•	Practical examples wwere helpful
	•	A final summary explaining how this template supports better product decisions

The final output should feel like a best practice artifact used by high-performing product teams.
